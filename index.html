					<h2>About Us</h2>

					<div id="bio">

						<p>In November of 2012, what would become The Keating Steps first came together. The group included TJ Alcala, Ian Grotton, Michael Prate, Michael Sansevere, Greg Stelzer, and Dan Stracquadanio, who met through friends and through Praise & Worship, a student-run Campus ministry program where students come together once a week to pray and reflect with music. The group pulled together their various musical talents into a band, performing at the Sound Out Sandy fundraiser under the name Movember & Sons. Realizing the potential of their group, they continued to play music together, emphasizing the power of vocal harmonies and the unbeatable raw energy of driving folk music.</p>

						<p> The band performed at various venues around Fordham, including The Blend Cafe and The Blackbox. In February of 2013, Delia Grizzard joined the band, and they played for the first time as The Keating Steps in Fordham’s McGinley Center, winning first place at the RHA Talent Showcase. Ava Gagliardi joined the group, and in April they performed at the Battle of the Bands at Rodrigue’s Coffee House. The band began performing shows alongside fellow Fordham folk band Bright Red Cardinal, including the first “Steps Show” in May, where the band performed for a large crowd on the Keating steps themselves. The next week, the group played their final show of the semester, and also their final show with Michael Prate, who has since been working as a Jesuit Volunteer in South Dakota.</p>

						<p>The band came back strong in the Fall of 2013, performing original songs for the first time. With Ian picking up the fiddle and TJ the accordion, they organized another Steps Show with other bands and performed with a new and unique sound. In November the band performed at Lincoln Center for the first time and made their return to Rodrigue’s in support of the Mexico and El Salvador Global Outreach projects. In December, The Keating Steps supported FLASH Magazine for their Fall publication (in which the band was also featured), performing at the 187th Street Ballroom, right off Arthur Avenue. The ballroom was also the venue for a huge “Welcome Back Show” in January of 2014, with the band performing alongside other big Fordham bands: Bright Red Cardinal, Senseless Sam and the Orangutans, King Mulhacen, and Second Child.</p>

						<p>Throughout all of their performances, The Keating Steps strive to deliver fun and meaningful music from the heart. They take advantage of the many different talents that each member brings to the table, switching instruments between songs and sharing microphones being a regular process. More and more the Steps have been working on new material, both new original songs and new ways to cover traditional folk songs. At the core of it, the Steps love to show the beautiful harmonies and driving rhythms of folk music to share their gifts and their love for music with the Fordham community.</p>
